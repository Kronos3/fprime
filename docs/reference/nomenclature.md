# Nomenclature

## F Prime Nomenclature Reference

The name chosen for our ecosystem invites several different ways of representing it in print. This guide provides the official representations for both formal and informal documents.
The representation can be in both long and short forms.
 
### Long form name representation: F Prime
Application: All Communication.  
Notes:  Capital F, capital P, with space in between. No dashes, underscores, lower case ‘f’ and ‘p’ or missing space.
 
### Short form name representation - formal: F′
Application: All Communication, notably presentations, papers, posters, user guides, proposals, etc.  
Notes: Capital F followed by the prime symbol. You can add a [prime symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol)) in PowerPoint, Word or Outlook by bringing up the Insert header, choosing Symbols, and selecting the prime symbol from the pop-up symbol list.
 
### Short form name representation – informal: F’
Application: Informal communication like email.  
Notes: Capital F followed by apostrophe.

### Software slug representation – software tokens: fprime
Application: Software tokens.
Notes: All lowercase 'fprime'. For use in software identifiers, repository names, etc.
 
### Usage
Generally the long and short forms can be used interchangeably, with a couple exceptions. In formal narrative documents (like papers or presentations), the first use of the name should be in the long form with subsequent uses in the short form as one would use an acronym (or can stick with the long form throughout). In major headers or banners where it is likely that the name will be seen for the first time by a wide audience, use the full name (long form) only. The software slug representation is only to be used as a token for software development i.e. as an identifier, part of a repository name, or anywhere else where spaces and special characters are prohibited.

Long form name representation: F Prime Prime  
Application: All Communication.  
Notes: Referring to it as “F double-prime” is acceptable in informal verbal communication, but not in print.
 
### Short form name representation: FPP

Referencing by short name (all communication): FPP  
Application: All Communication.  
Notes: Why is it F′ for the framework but not F′′ for the DSL? Because that’s the way it is! If you need a reason, it’s because FPP is easier to distinguish from F′ than F′′. But that’s not the reason!
